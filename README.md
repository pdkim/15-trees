##Feature Tasks:
 Create an application that for stack and queue methods. Stacks should be able to push and pop elements out of a list following the LIFO rules. Queues should have a dequeue and enqueue function that should adhere to the FIFO rules. In addition, queues should have methods to serialize and deserialize data.

###Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your device.
2. In terminal, enter npm i to install all dependencies.
  - If you are creating a new js file, be sure to require the tree.js file.
3. Create a new tree object and use tree.add(value). 

Ex.
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12);
````
Your list should have a new root node.

4. Use tree.add(lower than root's value).  

Ex.
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12); //this will be root
  tree.add(6);
```
You should have a node added to the root's left.

5. Use tree.add(higher than root's value).  

Ex.
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12); //this will be root
  tree.add(18);
```
You should have a nde added to the root's right.

6. Use tree.find(root's left or right value). 

Ex. 
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12); //this will be root
  tree.add(18);
  tree.add(6);
  tree.find(tree.root, 6);
```
You should have the value returned to you.

7. Use tree.remove(root's left or right value).  
Ex.
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12); //this will be root
  tree.add(18);
  tree.add(6);
  tree.remove(18);
```
You should have no left or right now.
8. Add the removed node again and run tree.serialize().  

Ex.  
```
  let tree = new Tree;
  tree.add(12); //this will be root
  tree.add(18);
  tree.add(6);
  let results = []
  tree.serialize(tree.root, results);
```

You should have data converted to text form.

9. Run tree.deserialize([10, 5, null, null, 15, null, null]).  

Ex.
```
  tree.deserialize([10, 5, null, null, 15, null, null])
```
Data should be back into a tree.
